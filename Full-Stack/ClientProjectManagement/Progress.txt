A simple text file to keep track of my progress and tasks at hand for this. Which is funny, as this is the very thing this project is meant to handle.
The main reason I am using a text file instead of something else is it's just me working on this. Using a visual board doesn't work well for an individual..this is from previous experience.
Times listed are approximate to the nearest 15 minutes. As it is just me working on the project, I am the only one doing the completing, therefore there is not a "who completed it"
