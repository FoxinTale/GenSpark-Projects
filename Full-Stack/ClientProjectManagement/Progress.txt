A simple text file to keep track of my progress and tasks at hand for this. Which is funny, as this is the very thing this project is meant to handle.
The main reason I am using a text file instead of something else is it's just me working on this. Using a visual board doesn't work well for an individual..this is from previous experience.
Times listed are approximate to the nearest 15 minutes. As it is just me working on the project, I am the only one doing the completing, therefore there is not a "who completed it"

A finished item does not indicate that it will not be touched again, only that the bulk of the work is completed to a point of "functionality". Changes can and will be made.
Deadline: May 9th, 2023.

	Item key:
		[ ] Indicates the item is to be done. 
		[x] Indicates the item is completed, and a date/time of completion is listed.
		[o] Indicates the item has been started or is in progress.
		[~] Indicates the item was cut or not done. Reason(s) stated at the end of item.
		An item with ** in front of it denotes it is on hold for another item to be completed.

Developer notes:
	Unsure of how I will link or assign users to a client. I may end up cutting the user all-together in favour of using the client.
	We'll have to noodle on this for a little while.
