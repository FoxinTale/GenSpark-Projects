# Projects
Projects and assignments related to GenSpark's Java training course.

### Project One (DragonText)
	This is a simple text based adventure project, the user is promted, then enters 1 or 2 and their fate is decided.
	
### Project 2 (Guess a Number)
	As the name implies, the user is asked to enter a number between 1 and 20. They have six tries to get it right.
	
### Project 3
	Essentially, adding exceptions (try/catch) loops to the two previous projects.
	
### Project 4
	Now we're adding unit testing to the previous projects. That's about it.
	
### Project 5
	A text based hangman game. With unit tests and exception handling.
	
### Project 6
	This is a text based game called "Humans versus Goblins", and the way I made it was a simplified version of Dungeons and Dragons.
	
### Project 7.
	Adding on to project 5, hangman. Making it more functional via adding file reading and writing (game art, player name and high score), and expection handling.
	
### Project 8.
	Adding on to project 6, "Humans versus Goblins". Adding a GUI to the whole thing to make it more user friendly.
