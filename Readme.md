# A MonoRepo for Genspark's training.
	I chose a monorepo "all in one" style because I found that, in the past monorepos are easier to manage and maintain in the long run. One place, no need to play "what repo was it again".

## Examples
	### Basics of OOP.
	A simple program with comments pointing out the basics (and four pillars) of Object Oriented Programming. 


## Spring Boot
	### Spring Boot Demo
	The first program written in spring Boot. (by me, anyways). 


## Spring-Core
	The basics relating to Java Spring Core module.
	
	### Example one (spring)
		Shows the basics of using Spring's beans using an XML based configuration system.
		
	### Example two:
	Shows the basics of using Annotation and Config based Bean Config.
	
	### Example 3 (AOP)
	Shows the basics of Spring's Aspect Oriented Programming.
	
	### Assignment 1
	A basic assignment using spring, and XML based configuration.
	
	### Assignment 2
	Similar to assignment 1, but using Annotation/Source based configuration. 
	
	

## Projects
Projects and assignments related to GenSpark's Java training course.

### Project One (DragonText)
	This is a simple text based adventure project, the user is promted, then enters 1 or 2 and their fate is decided.
	
### Project 2 (Guess a Number)
	As the name implies, the user is asked to enter a number between 1 and 20. They have six tries to get it right.
	
### Project 3
	Essentially, adding exceptions (try/catch) loops to the two previous projects.
	
### Project 4
	Now we're adding unit testing to the previous projects. That's about it.
	
### Project 5
	A text based hangman game. With unit tests and exception handling.
	
### Project 6
	This is a text based game called "Humans versus Goblins", and the way I made it was a simplified version of Dungeons and Dragons.
	
### Project 7.
	Adding on to project 5, hangman. Making it more functional via adding file reading and writing (game art, player name and high score), and expection handling.
	
### Project 8.
	Adding on to project 6, "Humans versus Goblins". Adding a GUI to the whole thing to make it more user friendly.
